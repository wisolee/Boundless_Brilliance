##The Detail View
You can enter a screen with more information about the presentation in question. Hopefully this helps keep you informed while you’re on the way to your presentation. You can also access a survey that the Boundless Brilliance team can review from this screen.
##Click on a presentation
Some important things to note:
Currently the app does not restrict access to the survey to the presenters. Be careful not to submit a survey for a presentation you did not participate in. You will not be able to rescind a survey once it’s submitted
Access to the survey is restricted until after the presentation has passed.

##The Survey
Here is where a presenter fills out information about the presentation after it is over. Some of this information is:
How many students are there?
What experiment was performed?
Transportation information: Who was your driver? Etc.

You are also given the option of adding additional information in a textfield. Once information is filled out, you can submit the presentation, and the information goes straight to our database!
